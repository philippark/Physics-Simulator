physics engine:
- get bouncing ball working
- kinematics: collisions
- springs
- ...

- collision detection, gravity, projectile motion
particle dynamics, fluid dynamics, or celestial mechanics

fun ideas:
- sand simulator
- fluid simulator
- mechanics

done so far:
- got graphics, and a ball (particle) to fall down at the speed of gravity

next step for this week 3/5/24:
- get it to bounce, just vertically.
- then, get it to bounce any direction
