physics engine:
- get bouncing ball working +
- kinematics: collisions
- springs
- ...

- collision detection, gravity, projectile motion
particle dynamics, fluid dynamics, or celestial mechanics

fun ideas:
- sand simulator
- fluid simulator
- mechanics

done so far:
- got graphics, and a ball (particle) to fall down at the speed of gravity
next step:
- get it to bounce, just vertically.
- then, get it to bounce any direction

3/6/24:
- ahead of plans, got multi-direction bounce completed
- next step, get collision with multiple balls
